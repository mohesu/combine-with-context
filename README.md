<summary><h2>✨ Features</h2></summary>

- Instantly copy selected code and context to the clipboard for quick sharing or use.
- Save selections directly as Markdown files for documentation or collaboration.
- Export chosen files and folders as a ZIP archive for easy transfer or backup.
- Effortlessly resave your last selection, streamlining repeated workflows.
- Supports advanced filtering (e.g., `.gitignore`, binary/image exclusion) for clean outputs.
- Handles large projects efficiently with progress notifications and error handling.
- **🆕 Enhanced Menu Placement**: Context menus now appear near copy/paste areas in both VS Code and JetBrains IDEs for better accessibility.
- **🆕 Visual Icons**: All commands now have intuitive icons for better recognition.
- **🆕 Smart Confirmations**: Automatic confirmation dialogs for large operations to prevent accidental processing.
- **🆕 Improved Performance**: Optimized file checking to avoid expensive operations during UI updates.
- **🆕 Better Accessibility**: Keyboard shortcuts now work globally in VS Code, not just in explorer view.
- Designed for reliability, traceability, and ease of use in production environments.

- **Multi-select**: Select any files and/or folders in VS Code Explorer.
- **Re-save/Update last output**: Once you've created a paste file or ZIP archive, you can regenerate it later using the same selection without reselecting files.  A single **Update last output** command determines which format to rebuild based on your most recent save.
- **LLM-friendly Markdown**: Each file block is clearly marked (with path, code block, timestamp); optional file tree and type-wise analysis.
- **Smart filtering**: Excludes binary files, images, large/empty files, and recognizes `.gitignore`.
  If you explicitly select a file or folder, it will be processed even if its parent directory is ignored by `.gitignore`.  Recognized file types (via the Markdown mapping) are always included.
- **Content compression**: Minifies code (trim whitespace, remove comments for JS/TS, Python, CSS) when enabled.
- **Symlink handling**: Configurable to skip or resolve symlinks.
- **User configuration**: Change output file, folder, append/overwrite, excludes, separators, etc., via settings.
- **One-click undo**: Restore a previous paste or ZIP file from history.
- **Clipboard mode**: Optionally copy context directly to clipboard.
- **Progress & warnings**: Notifies if selection is very large (lots of files or total MBs).
- **Output channel logging**: For debugging and traceability.
- **Production-ready**: Handles errors, permissions, and race conditions robustly.

<summary><h2>🛠 Usage</h2></summary>

1. **Select files/folders** in the VS Code Explorer.
2. **Right‑click** and choose **Save As → Save to paste file** or **Save As → Save selection as ZIP**.  The selected files will be aggregated and saved to your configured Markdown (`paste.md` by default) or ZIP (`context.zip` by default) file.
3. The output will appear in the designated file (or your chosen name/folder).
4. **Undo**: Use the **CC: Undo last save** command to restore the most recent backup of your paste or ZIP file.
5. **Clipboard**: Use the **CC: Copy to Clipboard** command/menu to copy the formatted context directly.
6. **Update**: After you've saved a paste or ZIP once, you can regenerate the output with the latest contents of the same files/folders. Right‑click and choose **CC: Update last output**; the extension will determine which format to regenerate based on your most recent save.

**📝 Note**: The same functionality is available in JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA 2023.2+, WebStorm 2023.2+, PyCharm 2023.2+, etc.) via the JetBrains plugin located in the [`jetbrains-plugin/`](./jetbrains-plugin/) directory. The plugin supports all IntelliJ Platform-based IDEs from version 2023.2 through 2024.3.
